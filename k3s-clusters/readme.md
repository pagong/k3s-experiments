# K3OS and K3 at work

[K3OS](https://github.com/rancher/k3os) is the custom built Linux distribution, 
that has just enough features to run the slimmed down Kubernetes distribution [K3s](https://github.com/rancher/k3s).

For me, both are the ideal tools to learn about Kubernetes and containerized applications.
