# K3OS and K3 at work

[Rancher Labs](https://rancher.com/) have created [k3OS](https://github.com/rancher/k3os) as a purpose built Linux distribution, 
that has just enough features to run their slimmed down Kubernetes distribution [K3s](https://github.com/rancher/k3s).

For me, both are the ideal tools to learn about Kubernetes and containerized applications.
